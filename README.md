# GasLeakApp

GasLeakApp is a mobile application developed using Flutter, designed to detect gas leaks using an MQTT server. The app establishes a connection with the MQTT server, and when a gas leak is detected, it triggers an alert in the form of a popup accompanied by vibration and a distinct sound, ensuring immediate attention to potential hazards.

Features
MQTT Integration: The app seamlessly integrates with an MQTT server to monitor and receive real-time data on gas levels.

Gas Leak Detection: GasLeakApp employs sophisticated algorithms to detect gas leaks, providing a timely response to potential safety risks.

Alert System: In case of a gas leak, the app triggers a multi-modal alert system, including a popup notification, vibration, and an audible alert, ensuring that users are promptly informed about the danger.
